this is a quick and dirty file renaming class. It's pretty simple: just create an instance of the `FileRenamer` class, passing in a regular expression to match the file names and a path for the files. Then, call the `rename_files` method to rename the files. See the `example.rb` file for a, well, an example. 

Of course, this is incredibly quick-and-dirty, so I'm sure you could improve it six ways 'til Sunday. So work some magic and send my a pull request!
